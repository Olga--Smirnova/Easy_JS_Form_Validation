# Simple_JS_Form_Validation

<p>HTML structure for an input field can look something as below. The only required element for HTML structure is an empty <b>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</b> after each input field. This is where the validation message appears if the validation failed. And don't forget to add <b>&lt;data="easyValidation"&gt;</b> to each of your input fields.</p>
